# GUI_Calculator_tkinter


In this section, we want to create a calculator with a graphical user interface in Python. We will use the Python tkinter module to make this calculator. tkinter is a standard Python library and does not need to be installed.

In the first step, we import the tkinter module from the Python standard library and create a class with the __init__ method. This class will be the main part of the calculator where the logic of the program is placed.

The next step is to add the button to the calculator. We add a new method called createButton() to the code. This method creates the button we want with the input value.

We add the buttons we have created to the graphic calculator with the addButton() method.

After we have completed the Python calculator graphics, it is time to define the function of each button.In this step, we perform mathematical operations with the clickButton() method.
